## Statistics


**There have been significant improvements in the educational levels of
Arabs, but the gaps between Arabs and Jews are still large.**

###### Dropping Out of High School

Dropout rates among Arab students continue to be above the rates of
Jewish students. In 2016, by age 17, 19.95% of Arab students had dropped
out of school versus 4% of Jewish students. This makes them ineligible
for most vocational training programs, and reduces their employment
prospects considerably. 

###### Not Finishing Highschool With Scores

More than 47% of the arab students in Israel finished highschools without finishing all the bagrut exams and successing in them ( getting a score above 55 )


## Minimum viable product (MVP) ?


* Our main target market for now are the arab highschools in Israel.
* The website will have only the languages that are spoken/used for education in Israel.
* The materials that we will have for now are only about the main subjects. *as English, Arabic, Hebrew, Mathmatics, Chemistry ..*


## What do we need to make this happen?


**Our role:** 

* Gather the materials from the ministry of education and keep it up to date.
* Provide easy way for the students and the teachers to use this platform. 
* Make our platform accessibly in the students'/teachers' languages

**Ministry of Education role:**

**Schools role:**

**Your role:**

## How can we make this scalable? 


* The teachers has the ability to edit the materials, add, upload and more.
* We will have our own 'content writers' who will add materials and update them accordingly.
* If we decided to go international, we will add choose your country in the login page, or dynamically detect which country is the teacher connected from by reading his IP Address. 
* Multiply languages will be supported ( as a stretch goal ).
