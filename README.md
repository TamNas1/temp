### Minimum viable product (MVP) ?

* Our main target market for now are the arab highschools in Israel.
* The website will have only the languages that are spoken/used for education in Israel.
* The materials that we will have for now are only about the main subjects. *as English, Arabic, Hebrew, Mathmatics, Chemistry ..*

### How can we make this scalable? 

* The teachers has the ability to edit the materials, add, upload and more.
* We will have our own 'content writers' who will add materials and update them accordingly.
* If we decided to go international, we will add choose your country in the login page, or dynamically detect which country is the teacher connected from by reading his IP Address. 
* Multiply languages will be supported ( as a stretch goal ).
